# SortingAlgorithmsBenchmarker
Program to test 5 different algorithms' speeds at sorting random integer arrays of different input sizes. Final project for Computational Thinking with Algorithms module.

This program runs benchmarks on five well known sorting algorithms.<br>
Bubble Sort<br>
Cocktail Sort<br>
Shell Sort<br>
Quick Sort<br>
Counting Sort<br>

Input to the sorting process is limited to the range of 0 to input size - 1.
There are 13 different input sizes and each input size is run ten times and an average taken. So, each algorithm runs 130 times.

The results of the average times are displayed in a grid to the console.

To run this program:<br>
1 Download project folder.<br>
2 Open a command prompt at src/ie/gmit/dip folder.<br>
3 Enter the command..   javac *.java<br>
4 Naviagte back to the src folder.<br>
5 Enter the command..   java ie.gmit.dip.AlgorithmBenchmarkRunner<br>
